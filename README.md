# PFfit

Package `pffit` provides simple tools to fit scattering 
phase functions based on diverse single and two-term empirical models.


### Installing

To install the package:
```
python setup.py install
```

or 

```
python setup.py install --user
```

## Examples
To apply the fitting modalities onto provided data (pffit/data) and generate the associated figures (in pffit/fig)

```
You should get this type of figures in pffit/fig
